# Moncton User Group - Hack Night #1

Welcome to our first Moncton User Group Hack Night (February 21, 2017). Below you will find information on how the night will proceed and a few seed projects already set up to get started.

The goal for this evening is for everyone to learn, share, experiment and form relationship with their peers.


## Schedule

### 6:30pm to 7:00pm: Introductions

We will go around the room and ask everyone to introduce themselves. We will try to form groups of 2 to 4 people that can work together.

If you have a project that you would like to work on outside of our seed projects, this is the time to let us know.

This is also  a good time to make sure that your computer works, can go on the internet, etc.


### 7:00pm - 8:30pm: Work on a project

Now that everyone is in group, it's time to get started. Each group will be on their own. A few of us will be going around the room to make sure no one is blocked and always making forward progress.


### 8:30pm - 9:00pm: Status  reports and/or Demos

At the end of the night we'd like for at least one member of each group to talk about what they worked on and how it went. If there's something to show, a demo would be great.


## Projects

We set up a few seed project ideas in advance.
